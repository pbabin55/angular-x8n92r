Qi circulates through out the body within the  meridians, which also are related to the internal organs. Good health depends  on the smooth flow of qi. When the flow of qi is blocked due to trauma, stress,  poor diet, medications, hereditary conditions, environmental factors, or  excessive emotional issues, the system is disrupted.

Most of all, acupuncture stimulates the body’s  natural ability to heal itself.              </p>
